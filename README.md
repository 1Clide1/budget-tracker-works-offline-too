## Description

With this budget tracker my main goal was not the budget tracker itself but making this app into a complete PWA app that lets you track your budget whether you are online or offline.

## Installation

To use this app you can just click the link above and that will take you to the website, there you can either save it to your desktop or phone as a PWA app or you can just use it in the browser.

## Usage

The reason you would want to use this app is if you needed to track your overall budget with the benefit of the app working whether you are on or offline.

## Credits

I feel like indexxedDB and service workers are very interesting and feel similar to the regular backend layout. I tried to leave a lot of comments mainly for myself when I revisit this type of subject in the future and use what I learned here to build upon that and creating another PWA app. I feel like it was confusing at first but I think I got the hang of it overall!
